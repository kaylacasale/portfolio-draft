## User Story
AS a **developer**

I want to maintain and develop a working portfolio within a deployed website

SO THAT **employers** can view my work samples at any time and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to showcase my previous work in a deployed webpage

WHEN an employer loads my portfolio

THEN they are presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section 

WHEN I click on the link to the section about my work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my applications

WHEN I am presented with the first applivation

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Mock-up
The following image shows the web application's appearance.

## Focus Points
clickable navigation elements, images that link to external pages, interactive contact form open to text submissions, auto-resizing of webpage
